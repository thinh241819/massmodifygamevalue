# massmodifygamevalue
Just a fun little program. I was trying to mod Torchlight, and it is too annoying to calculate the value by hand and input them, so I create a small program to do it for me.
*** Feateures to add:
* Use Path file instead of directly modify the program
* Check if path is correct, output a message if none.
* Allow the user to scan for a specific sentinel, and then change the value behind the sentinel
* Allow the user to identify tags format. For example : [/POINT] ...abcxyz... [POINT] is a specific tag. In this case, being able to identify tags allow us to manipulate the file according to their scope, makes it a lot easier to modify.
